# Portfolio - James Calverley

For this homework assignment I have created the very first version of my portfolio site. 

3 pages were created:
   - About (index.html)
   - Portfolio (portfolio.html)
   - Contact (contact.html)

About: 
- included nav bar with 3 links
- added a hero image
- used Bootstrap columns for about me section

Portfolio
- used Bootstrap cards to display portfolio items
- used flex to display portfolio cards
* need to fix responsiveness for portfolio cards

Contact 
- used Bootstrap forms for contact form 


## Next Steps

For the next version of my portfolio site, I would like to: 
- fix all responsiven issues
- add a sticky footer
- explore differnt designs, themes, colours and fonts
- add functional links (link "about"  to scroll to "about me" section)
- add a functional contact form
